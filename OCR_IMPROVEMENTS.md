# Smart Goggles OCR Improvements

This document outlines the text detection improvements implemented in the Smart Goggles prototype.

## Core Improvements

### 1. Enhanced OCR Module Integration

- Added multiple preprocessing methods for better text detection
- Integrated multiple OCR services (Tesseract, Azure, AWS) for flexibility
- Added confidence scoring for OCR results
- Enhanced text visualization with highlighted regions

### 2. Object-Based Text Detection

- Added text feature analysis to object detection
- Objects are now analyzed for text-like features even in normal mode
- Text detection is now integrated with object recognition
- Special highlighting for objects containing text

### 3. Advanced Text Region Detection

- MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Regions) for detecting text regions
- Gradient analysis to find areas with text-like patterns
- Edge detection and morphological operations for better text isolation
- Region merging to combine fragmented text

### 4. User Experience Improvements

- OCR mode now persists for 5-8 seconds (longer when text is found)
- Real-time visual feedback with confidence scores
- Better guidance for positioning camera to capture text
- Semi-transparent overlays for improved readability

### 5. Configuration Options

- Added customizable OCR service selection in .env file
- Configurable confidence thresholds
- Multiple API services supported
- Preprocessing toggles

## Technical Details

### Text Feature Analysis

The system now analyzes images for text features using multiple methods:

1. **Edge Density Analysis**: Text typically has a higher density of edges
2. **Texture Analysis**: Text has distinctive texture patterns
3. **Horizontal Line Detection**: Text often contains horizontal alignments
4. **Vertical Spacing Analysis**: Text has consistent vertical spacing
5. **Gradient Direction Analysis**: Text has characteristic gradient directions

### Text Region Detection

Text regions are now detected using a combination of:

1. **MSER Algorithm**: For detecting stable regions with consistent intensity
2. **Gradient Analysis**: For finding regions with sharp transitions
3. **Morphological Operations**: For cleaning up and connecting text regions
4. **Contour Analysis**: For defining boundary boxes around text regions

### OCR Processing Pipeline

The enhanced OCR processing now includes:

1. **Initial Frame Analysis**: Detect potential text regions
2. **Multi-Method Preprocessing**:
   - Contrast enhancement
   - Adaptive thresholding
   - Noise reduction
3. **Text Extraction**: Apply OCR to each region with multiple methods
4. **Result Integration**: Combine and rank results by confidence
5. **Visualization**: Display results with confidence indicators

## Usage Tips

- **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting for better text detection
- **Distance**: Hold camera 20-40cm from text for optimal results
- **Stability**: Keep camera steady during OCR processing
- **Contrast**: Text with good contrast against background works best
- **Size**: Medium to large text is detected more reliably

## Future Improvements

- Real-time text tracking across video frames
- Language identification and translation
- Handwriting recognition
- Text-to-speech synchronization with highlighted words
- Semantic understanding of detected text
